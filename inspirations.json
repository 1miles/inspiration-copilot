As they brainstorm, Andrew expresses frustration over the complexity of the proposal, while Katelyn emphasizes the importance of community voices in the decision-making process. Miles, leveraging his tech skills, proposes creating an interactive online tool that simplifies the zoning information and allows residents to express their views easily.\n\nThe friction arises as Andrew worries about the accuracy of the information being shared, while Katelyn is concerned about engaging those who are typically disengaged. Miles sees an opportunity to bridge this gap with technology, but Andrew's skepticism about tech solutions creates tension. Ultimately, they realize that combining Katelyn's grassroots organizing with Miles' tech-savvy approach could empower the community to take a stand."

Andrew, on the other hand, believes that the information being presented needs to be more accessible and engaging.\n\nKatelyn emphasizes the importance of creating a welcoming environment for all community members, while Chad worries about the potential for disengagement. Andrew suggests incorporating interactive elements, such as Q&A sessions and live polls, to make the forum more engaging. Tensions arise as they debate the best approach to increase attendance, but they ultimately agree that a combination of Katelyn's community-building efforts and Andrew's focus on accessibility could create a more inviting atmosphere."

Chad, feeling intimidated by the technical jargon, voices concerns about the accessibility of these solutions for average citizens. Through dialogue, they identify that a simplified portal with intuitive visuals and community feedback features would support both transparency and engagement, ultimately championing clearer communication between citizens and their government."
