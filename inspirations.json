Katelyn feels frustrated, believing that without a clear budget, they risk overspending and ruining the trip.\n\nAs the discussion unfolds, Katelyn's anxiety about being perceived as controlling surfaces, while Miles worries about the financial implications of a spontaneous trip. Chad tries to lighten the mood, suggesting they could find a way to make it work without strict financial constraints. This scenario highlights the need for a collaborative budgeting tool that allows for transparency and flexibility, enabling the group to enjoy their trip without the stress of financial mismanagement."
